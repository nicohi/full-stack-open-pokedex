# Exercise 1, 200-300 words about CI/CD

Let's consider the application in question is developed in Python. 

1. In the Python ecosystem, CI setup can include tools like PyLint for linting. PyLint meticulously checks for errors in Python code, enforces a coding standard and looks for code smells. It can also make suggestions for refactoring. For testing, PyTest or unittest (a built-in Python library) are commonly used. They provide a way to create tests, ensuring new changes don't break the application. Lastly, builders in Python such as setuptools and distutils ease the process of distributing Python code, making it an appropriate choice for building.

2. Several alternatives exist for CI setup besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions. GitLab CI/CD stands out for its native integration with the GitLab framework. CircleCI is another prominent tool for its ease of setup and maintenance. Bitbucket Pipelines, TeamCity, and Travis CI are also utilized due to their features and integration capabilities.

3. Choosing between a self-hosted and a cloud-based environment depends on the requirements, resources, and constraints of the project. A self-hosted environment offers more control and customization but requires the team to manage upkeep and server issues. A cloud-based environment provides scalability, eliminates the need for server management, and commonly suits companies that prefer third-party maintenance. Important factors for choosing cloud or self-hosting are the team's technical capability, budget, expected scale of the application, availability of resources, and company's policies toward data security and compliance.
